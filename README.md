<a href="https://akifgrape.github.io/cutter">To play Once you're on the site</a>, you'll see a 3D grid of cubes. You can use your mouse to move the virtual knife around the screen. To slice a cube, click and drag the knife across the surface of the cube. The cube will split into two or more pieces, and you'll earn points for each piece you cut.

As you play, the cubes will continue to spawn and move around the screen, so you'll need to be quick and precise with your cuts. You'll also need to avoid hitting any of the obstacles that are scattered throughout the game. If you hit an obstacle, your score will be reset to zero.

Overall, "Cutter" is a fast-paced and addictive game that challenges your hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Give it a try and see how many cubes you can slice!
